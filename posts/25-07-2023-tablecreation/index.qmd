kableExtra is the package in R and helps us to build common complex tables and also manipulate table styles. Today we are going to learn the use of `{kableExtra}` to make tables. And we are using `penguins` from `{palmerpenguins}`dataset for that.

To use the package we have to call it. Here we called `{kableExtra}` and  `{palmerpenguins}` packages.
These are the top six rows of the `penguins` data set.

```{r}
#|label: head of penguin data 
library(kableExtra)
library(palmerpenguins)
peng <- head(penguins)
peng

```
>same way we can see last rows by using tail() function

## Table Themes
There are many themes present in package and we can use them according to our need. 
For more themes you can visit to <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/kableExtra/vignettes/awesome_table_in_html.html>

Here we use `{kable_classic_2}`
```{r}
kbl(peng) |>
  kable_classic_2()

```
## Table Heading 
Whenever we make a table then it is good practice to give heading to the table. For heading, we can use caption argument in `{kbl}` and give it some values which we be your heading.  

```{r}
kbl(peng, caption = "Recreating booktabs style table") |>
  kable_classic_2() 
```



## Text hovering
This package also give us a option to hover. And we can set it width by giving it a of True/False

```{r}
kbl(peng) |>
  kable_classic_2("hover", full_width = F)
```

## Highlighting the column 
In some case we want to highlight columns, then, `column_spec()` function we can use. 
```{r}
kbl(peng) |>
  kable_classic_2() |> 
  column_spec(2, color = "red")
```

## Font styles 

We all know there are various types of font available on internet and we can use that in our tables. We have to give an argument `html_font` and give the name of font as a value in html_font. 
```{r}

kbl(peng) |>
  kable_classic_2("hover", html_font = "Cambria")
```
